It’s time to let the guns talk and soon everyone is aiming at everyone. The richest surviving gangster wins the game!

Ca$h 'n Gun$ will make you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. Fun, bluffing, and tough negotiations are guaranteed, but will you dare to play? It's simply killing!

On each turn, a player will assume the role of ""The Don"", and will call out the steps in gameplay.

Before the skirmish itself, an available pot of cash will be laid out before the players. This pot must be evenly split up amongst all of the surviving hoods.

After that, the ""Don"" of the round will ask the players, including himself, to load their guns (in the form of selecting one of three possible cards: ""Bang!"", ""Bang! Bang! Bang!"" or ""Click! Click!"" from a set of 8 cards: 2 ""Bang!""s, 1 Triple-""Bang!"" and 5 ""Clicks!""), and then count down to all of the players aiming their guns (real foam guns).

Each player will then take a look at how many guns are pointed at them, and also take a look at the available pot of cash for the round before deciding if they want to ""Chicken Out"" and remove themselves from the skirmish. If they choose to back down, they will get a ""Chicken"" token which will deduct from their ill-gotten gains at the end of the game.
But all players have to ""Chicken Out"" at the same time, using a countdown like the aiming.

The remaining players will resolve the shootout showing their cards. First, all Triple-""Bangs!"" wound the players they are aimed at. If there are still-aiming players with ""Bang!"" cards, those now wound their targets. ""Click!""s are only bluffs and do nothing. A player that is wounded during the standoff does not participate in the split of the cash and receives a bandage (any player that receives a certain number of bandages is eliminated from the game). Now all the used cards are discarded--even those of the players that ""Chickened Out"".

Now the remaining players will finally split the cash. If the cash cannot be divided evenly, the rest is kept on the table and is added to the new pot.

The game is played 8 rounds, until all cards were played. Keeping track of the cards is important, since all players have only a limited supply of ""real"" shots.

There are a couple of expansions packed-in with most editions that change some of the mechanics of the game, and also add a new ""traitor""-based mechanic, as well.

In this game you start at 221B and travel through the streets and alleys of London picking up clues and attempting to solve the most intriguing cases Holmes and Watson have ever faced.

Each player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction.  Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime. Clues are hidden throughout London, one in each of fourteen locations. Players must collect clues from each location, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card.

Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something vital almost anywhere in town.  The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to 221B and announce the solution, is the winner.

The original 221B Baker Street Board game was created and copyrighted by American writer Jay Moriarty (dba Antler Productions) in 1975.  The Brazilian version of this game is known as Scotland Yard, not to be confused with the 1983 Spiel des Jahres winner also called Scotland Yard.

The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (“One! One! One!”, or “Three! Three! Three!”) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring “Corner on Wheat!” or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points.

The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wild-card and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10.

Pit’s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt’s Stock Exchange (G-S-E) invented by Harry Gavitt. While G-S-E claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit.  In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903.  Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse', a remarkably similar open-outcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80-card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull.  Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on open-outcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.

Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters.

The game has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, and became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen, Norway. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.

Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.

During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: ""Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?"" or ""Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?""

In order to evade the surveillance of the guards who eyed their arrival suspiciously, all four will pull off their heists simultaneously, then dash to the exit.

Magic Maze is a real-time, cooperative game. Each player can control any hero in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which the other players do not have access: Move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator… All this requires rigorous cooperation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes prudently. However, you are allowed to communicate only for short periods during the game; the rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other. If all of the heroes succeed in leaving the shopping mall in the limited time allotted for the game, each having stolen a very specific item, then everyone wins together.

At the start of the game, you have only three minutes in which to take actions. Hourglass spaces you encounter along the way give you more time. If the sand timer ever completely runs out, all players lose the game: Your loitering has aroused suspicion, and the mall security guards nab you!

Designed by the creators at Eon of Cosmic Encounter fame, some contend that the game can best be described as Cosmic Encounter set within the Dune universe, but the two games bear little in common in the actual mechanisms or goals; they're just both set in space. Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates player interaction through negotiation and bluffing.

Players each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune. Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game. Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces. A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong. When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty.

The game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.

Note that the Descartes edition of Dune includes the Duel Expansion and Spice Harvest Expansion, the Landsraad variant from Avalon Hill's General magazine, and additional character disks not provided by AH.

Pictomania lasts five rounds, and at the start of each round, you set up six randomly drawn cards on card racks visible to all players. Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.

Players simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too. Once you have finished drawing and guessing – and you're not required to do either – take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions. Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends.

One by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made. Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table. Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep – the player who made the worst guesses. If a single player has more cards in the center of the table than anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What's more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep ""bonus"" and all the scoring tokens you didn't give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.

Reset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round. The player with the highest score after five rounds wins.

Whoever lost a challenge and had to place the card before him on the table begins the next round.

The game ends when a player has no cards to pass on his turn or when a player has four cards of the same critter on the table in front of him. In either case, this player loses and everyone else wins.

But once its basic rules are understood, Go shows its staggering depth. One can see why many people say it's one of the most elegant brain-burning abstract games in history, with players trying to claim territory by walling off sections of the board and surrounding each other's stones.  The game doesn't end until the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.

The earliest mention of Go (åœæ£‹ (wéi qí)- ""surrounding game"") appears in the ""Analects"" of Confucius (551-479 BC), while the earliest physical evidence is a 17×17 Go board discovered in 1952 in a tomb of the former Han dynasty (206 BC- 9 AD). There is a tangle of conflicting popular and scholarly anecdotes attributing its invention to two Chinese emperors, an imperial vassal and court astrologers. One story has it that Go was invented by the legendary Emperor Yao (ruled 2357-2256 BC) as an amusement for his idiot son. A second claims that the Emperor Shun (ruled 2255-2205 BC) created the game in hopes of improving his weak-minded son's mental prowess. A third says the person named Wu, a vassal of the Emperor Jie (ruled 1818-1766 BC), invented Go (as well as games of cards). Finally, a fourth story suggests that Go was developed by court astrologers during the Zhou dynasty (1045-255 BC).

A Go set, consisting of a very general-purpose grid and colored stones, can also be used to play a variety of other abstract strategy games, such as Connect6, Go-Moku, and Pente.

In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.

In the game, players represent one of the seven ""Great Powers of Europe"" (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of ""orders."" The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers.

Each player has a set of 15 checkers (or stones) that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of their checkers to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other's checkers, forcing the captured checkers to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 checkers off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the ""doubling cube"", which allows players to up the stakes of the game. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll and measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.

Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.

The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard which means ""Battle on Wood"". In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (""game of twelve marks""), later, Tabula (""table""), and by the sixth century, Alea (""dice""). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from ""Bac gamen"" meaning ""Back Game"", referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.

It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called ""The Aristocratic Game."" The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world's first travel edition?).

The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle. These remained popular until the American innovations of the 1930s.

While featuring cooperative gameplay similar to Forbidden Island, Forbidden Desert is a fresh, new game based around an innovative set of mechanisms such as an ever-shifting board, individual resource management, and a unique method for locating the flying machine parts.

The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.

The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the ""normal"" spread of the infections.

Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!

During a hellish thunderstorm, on the stroke of midnight, there echoes a bone-chilling scream. The townsfolk rush to investigate and find the town storyteller murdered, their body impaled on the hands of the clocktower, blood dripping onto the cobblestones below. A Demon is on the loose, murdering by night and disguised in human form by day. Some have scraps of information. Others have abilities that fight the evil or protect the innocent. But the Demon and its evil minions are spreading lies to confuse and breed suspicion. Will the good townsfolk put the puzzle together in time to execute the true demon and save themselves? Or will evil overrun this once peaceful village?

Blood on the Clocktower is a bluffing game enjoyed by 5 to 20 players on opposing teams of Good and Evil, overseen by a Storyteller player who conducts the action and makes crucial decisions. The goal of the game is to successfully deduce and execute the demons before they outnumber the townfolk.

During a 'day' phase players socialize openly and whisper privately to trade knowledge or spread lies, culminating in a player's execution if a majority suspects them of being Evil. Of a 'night' time, players close their eyes and are woken one at a time by the Storyteller to gather information, spread mischief, or kill.

The Storyteller uses the game's intricate playing pieces to guide each game, leaving others free to play without a table or board. Players stay in the thick of the action to the very end even if their characters are killed, haunting Ravenswood Bluff as ghosts trying to win from beyond the grave.

If you arrive late to a game, you can enter after it's started as a powerful Traveller character with unusual talents and questionable allegiances. Each character comes with their own special ability and no two players in a game are ever the same character.

Be quick and be quiet. One false step and CLANK! Each careless sound draws the attention of the dragon, and each artifact stolen increases its rage. You can enjoy your plunder only if you make it out of the depths alive!

Clank! is a deck-building game. Each player has their own deck, and building yours up is part of playing the game. You start each of your turns with five cards in your hand, and you'll play them all in any order you choose. Most cards will generate resources, of which there are three different kinds:


    Skill, which is used to acquire new cards for your deck.
    Swords, which are used to fight the monsters that infest the dungeon.
    Boots, which are used to move around the board.


Every time you acquire a new card, you put it face up in your discard pile. Whenever you need to draw a card and find your deck empty, you shuffle your discard pile and turn it face down to form a new deck. With each shuffle, your newest cards become part of a bigger and better deck! Each player starts with the same cards in their deck, but they’ll acquire different cards during their turns. Because cards can do many different things, each player’s deck (and strategy) will become more and more different as the game unfolds.

During the game, you have two goals:

    Retrieve an Artifact token and escape the dragon by returning to the place you started, outside of the dungeon.
    Accumulate enough points with your Artifact and other loot to beat out your opponents and earn the title of Greatest Thief in the Realm!

Summary

The players of Sagrada focus on two goals: First, they want to learn or revise the core vocabulary of Spanish nouns (about 800 words). Second, the players want to complete the unfinished church La Sagrada Familia. Towards this end, each player gets a number of jigsaw puzzle pieces which they have to buy during the game. The required money is earned by trading in language cards and asset cards. The game ends when one player has bought and laid out all their puzzle pieces and also manages to correctly solve five of the language cards he/she has collected during the game.

The game mechanics in more detail

A die determines the players' movement on the game board. The board contains the following types of spaces:
Event spaces and special spaces: The player draws a card from the corresponding stack. Event cards must be played immediately, special cards can be kept until needed.
Attraction spaces: The player receives an asset card of the corresponding tourist attraction. Different attractions have cards worth different amounts of money.
Language spaces: The player gets a language card, which they have to learn during the game. Each language card contains two different words or phrases in German and Spanish.
Metro spaces can be used either as a shortcut to a different metro space, or as an event, special or language space (player's choice).
Bank spaces: On a bank space, the player can exchange asset and language cards for money. To do so, they must have learned the language cards. During an exchange attempt, one asset card and two language cards are submitted. The German words are read out, and if the active player correctly translates them to Spanish, he/she receives the amount of money specified on the asset card. If they fail, they get back their cards and can try again later.
Casa de Pledras spaces: The player can pay for one of his puzzle pieces to be added to the puzzle that is laid out on the table (all players contribute to one puzzle).

The deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.

When the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player(s) with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card.

Play begins with a judge, known as the ""Card Czar"", choosing a black question or fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players.  Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an ""Awesome Point"", and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.

This, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like ""Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor"".

In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are ""Pick 2"" or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.

Each edition is the same game at its core, but the features, compatible expansions, and production differ among them. This entry is for the original 1977 Eon version.

Players represent alien races that are seeking to spread themselves onto five foreign worlds.  To accomplish this, they make challenges against other players and enlist the aid of interested parties.  But alien powers, which are unique to each race, give players ways to bend or outright break some rule in the game.

The game continues until one player occupies five planets in other systems to win. Shared victories are possible and a player need not occupy one's own system to win.

The classic detective game!  In Clue, players move from room to room in a mansion to solve the mystery of: who done it, with what, and where?  Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make a suggestion against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards mentioned if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more suggestions.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file, and then make an accusation. If correct, the player wins, but if incorrect, the player must return the cards to the file without revealing them and may no longer make suggestions or accusations. A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.

Note: There are some early versions of Clue which are labeled as 2-6 players. Recent and current issues of the game state 3-6 players.

A team of two players – neighbors at the table – choose a word or phrase that the other players need to guess. Acting together, this team places pieces judiciously on the available icons on the game board.

To get others to guess ""milk"", for example, the team might place the question mark icon (which signifies the main concept) on the liquid icon, then cubes of this color on the icons for ""food/drink"" and ""white"". For a more complicated concept, such as ""Leonardo DiCaprio"", the team can use the main concept and its matching cubes to clue players into the hidden phrase being an actor or director, while then using sub-concept icons and their matching cubes to gives clues to particular movies in which DiCaprio starred, such as Titanic or Inception.

The first player to discover the word or phrase receives 2 victory points, the team receives points as well, and the player who ends up with the most points wins.

Take care with what you add, though, for a pinch too much of this or that will spoil the whole mixture!

Each player has their own bag of ingredient chips. During each round, they simultaneously draw chips from their bags and add them to their pots. The higher the face value of the drawn chip, the further it is placed in the pot's swirling pattern, increasing how much the potion will be worth. Push your luck as far as you can, but if you add too many cherry bombs, your pot will explode!

At the end of each round, players gain victory points and coins to spend on new ingredients, depending on how well they managed to fill up their pots. But players whose pots have exploded must choose points or coins — not both! The player with the most victory points at the end of nine rounds wins the game.

The order of elimination is randomly determined at the start of play, forcing you to thinking in different ways each game.

The object of the game is to win the pot which contains all the bets the players have made in a deal.  Players are dealt cards which are usually reduced to a Poker hand of five (5) cards. Betting and bluffing are used in rounds until all bets are squared up, or until all other players have conceded the pot (folded). If all bets have been squared up, the rounds are followed by a ""showdown"" in which all hands are fully revealed; the one with the best combination of a Poker hand of five (5) cards being the winner.

The following table describes and ranks the standard Poker hands:

Five of a Kind (Only if wild cards are in use):  Four cards of the same rank and one wild card (eg: A, A, A, A, Joker).
Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10: all spades). (The highest Straight Flush is nominally called a Royal Flush)
Four of a Kind:  Four cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, A, K).
Full House:  Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (eg: A, A, A, K, K). 
Flush:  Five cards of the same suit (eg: A, K, Q, J, 9: all spades)
Straight:  Five cards in sequence of rank (eg: A, K, Q, J, 10).
Three of a Kind:  Three cards of the same rank (eg: A, A, A, K, Q).
Two Pair:  Two pairs of different ranks (eg: A, A, K, K, Q).

Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets – goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.

""The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket – each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,"" says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. ""The tension comes from being forced to balance greed – adding more cards to your hand, and fear – losing a critical route to a competitor.""

Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.

Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a ""gateway game"" -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.

On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.

Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.

A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities—think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.

Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.

CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.

Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.
